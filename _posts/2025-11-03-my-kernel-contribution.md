# 🌱 My Name in the Linux Kernel (6.18-rc4): A Small Patch, a Big Moment

A few days ago, I opened the changelog for **Linux 6.18-rc4** and saw something that made my heart skip a beat — **my name listed as a contributor**.  

It might seem like just a line in a massive tree of patches, but to me, it meant the world. ❤️

## 🧑‍💻 Why It Feels So Special

The **Linux kernel** isn’t just software — it’s one of the largest and most respected open-source projects in the world. Thousands of developers contribute to it. Every patch, every line, goes through careful review, discussion, and refinement before it’s accepted.

Seeing my name there wasn’t about vanity — it was about **becoming part of something bigger**.  
Something that runs in servers, phones, routers, and even spacecraft.  
Something built collaboratively by people from all over the globe.

## 🧩 The Journey to That One Line

When I submitted my first patch, I honestly wasn’t sure it would make it.  
I went through what every new contributor experiences:
- Reading through the [kernel contribution guide](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html)  
- Making sure my patch followed the strict formatting and commit rules  
- Submitting it to the correct mailing list and maintainers  
- Waiting for reviews (and nervously refreshing my inbox 😅)  
- Responding to feedback and making improvements  

When it was finally accepted, I felt a wave of relief, excitement, and gratitude.  
It wasn’t just my code — it was the **community’s trust** that made it possible.

## 🧠 What I Learned Along the Way

This experience taught me so much more than I expected:

- **Patience is essential.** Kernel reviews can take time — and that’s okay.  
- **Clarity matters.** A good patch isn’t only about fixing a bug; it’s about writing something understandable and maintainable.  
- **Respect the process.** Reviewers and maintainers give their time freely; their feedback makes you better.  
- **Open source is teamwork.** Every accepted patch stands on the shoulders of shared effort.

## 🌍 More Than Just Code

When I saw my name appear in the changelog, I realized it’s not just about the contribution itself.  
It’s about **belonging** — to a global, open-source movement that values collaboration, transparency, and learning.  

It’s about knowing that my small change is now part of something that runs on millions of systems around the world.  
That’s a feeling words barely capture.

## 🙏 Thank You, Open-Source Community

To the maintainers who reviewed my patch — thank you.  
To the people who answered my newbie questions — thank you.  
To everyone who contributes to the Linux kernel, from documentation to testing — you’re the reason this ecosystem thrives.  

This milestone might be small, but it means a lot.  
It’s proof that persistence, curiosity, and community can take you anywhere.  

---

## 🚀 What’s Next?

This isn’t the end; it’s just the beginning.  
I plan to:
- Contribute more patches  
- Deepen my understanding of kernel subsystems  
- Help new contributors who want to take their first step  

Because the best part of open source is sharing the journey.

## 💬 Closing Thought

If you’ve ever hesitated to contribute to open source — **go for it.**  
Start small. Read. Ask questions. Submit that patch.  
Your name might soon appear in a changelog too — and trust me, it’s one of the best feelings in the world.
